# Sheep_Counter
A counter to store the number of sheep entering and leaving a fence.</br>
Used arduino uno R3 and two ultrasonic sensors for the circuit.</br>
One ultrasonic sensor is used to count the sheeps entering the fence and another sensor is used to count the sheeps leaving the fence.</br>
A variable count can be used to add sheeps if they enter the fence and subtract if they leave the fence.</br>
Read the ultrasonic sensors using the respective trigger pins and echo pins attached to the arduino.</br>
The ultrasonic sensors wil count the sheeps if the distance is less than 100 cm.</br>
Finally print the value in the serial monitor.
